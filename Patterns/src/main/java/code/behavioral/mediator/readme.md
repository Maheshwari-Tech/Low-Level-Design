# Mediator Design Pattern

* Encourage loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicit
and allows them to communicate through a mediator object.


## Example - 
* Online Auction System
* Airline Management System - 2 planes never talk to each other; communicate through mediator. 
* Chat Application LLD 
*
